babytalk (tampermonkey script)

a babytalk filter for the text on https://baby fur.me/

installation:

1. install a tampermonkey interpreter, I use this one: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag

2. download the script

3. go to chrome-extension://jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag/options/index.html#scripts and press the "+" then the "new" and copy the contents of the script to the text editor that appears.

4. hit "save and close", then go to https://baby fur.me/ and refresh. 

5. if it seems to fail to work, then click the puzzle piece icon by the address bar, and click on "violent monkey" then hit the switch next to "babyvoice" to turn it on
